# shopping-list

This is a web-app I built, although it can be used entirely as a website too. It is a completely functional shopping list that uses a database to store the items, which allows it to sync across multiple devices. 

That makes it perfect to share in households - you can add food items when they run out, and you also now have a place for when you're asked to add something to the shopping list. 

I personally use my own version of this in my house but if you want to test out a public one I made, you can do so here: https://rishishoppingpublic.netlify.app - this is completely public and open. Feel free to try it out!

There are some instructions in the info section at the top, feel free to have a read for how to add it to the homescreen on your phone to be able to use it as an app. It gives a completely different experience to the website, without the tabs or url section, when it becomes its own mobile app. 

Please have a go using it, and let me know any feedback you have. 

Enjoy!

P.S. If you use this site, items can get added and deleted by other people testing it out.
